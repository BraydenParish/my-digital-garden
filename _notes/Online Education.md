Why is college so expensive? Why does college take so long?

Does college need to be 4 years long?

How much of the material do students forget?

Imagine paying $40,000, and 4 years of your life on something that you dont even remember that well, and maybe not even that valuable.

Of course just having the diploma itself is insanely valuable, but still.

Having a college degree gives you an enormous advantage, I definitely recommend people getting one. But don't spend too much money, don't go into debt.

We need to make it easier on young americans to get degrees, and not be in debt for the rest of their lives

If you do 4 years a college, get a degree in computer science and come out not knowing how to code well. That's a broken system. It should be improved, you should be making a ton of programming projects.

In my path of learning programming, I forgot a lot of the information I read or studied. The information I remember usually came from when I was building projects, it's a much more organic way of learning.

This guy named [[Justin Sung]] on youtube posts soem great stuff on how to learn most effectively. [[Cognitive Science]]
