The Lebombo Bone, is a bone from 44,200 years ago that had tallies on the bone. Supposed to represent counting.

There is even evidence that animals like birds can recognize counting. For instance lets say a bird leaves the bird nest that has 3 eggs and comes back to 2 eggs, the bird will know an egg is missing immediately.

Counting started from the eeny, mini, miny, moe technique. 1 bone, 2 bone, 3 bone, 4 bone,
